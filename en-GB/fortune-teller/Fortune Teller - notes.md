title: Fortune Teller — Notes for Club Leaders
---

#Introduction:
In this project, children will learn how to make use of selection, by making a 'fortune teller'. The fortune teller will work like a magic 8-ball, and will give the user the answer to a question they ask the micro:bit.

#Resources
For this project, the [Code Kingdoms](http://jumpto.cc/mb-new) microbit editor should be used.

You can find a completed version of this project at [microbit.co.uk/dkqhbx](https://www.microbit.co.uk/dkqhbx), and the compiled .hex file can be downloaded by clicking the 'Download Project Materials' link for this project, which contains:

+ The `random` block.

#Challenges
+ "Fixing the scrolling text!" - Changing the number in a `say` block to fix a problem with the speed of scrolling text;
+ "Multiple answers" - Consolidating use if `if` blocks, by adding 'No' and 'Ask again' answers.
